- Suggests safe place, stability
- Less action-oriented than Beacon
- Better suited for deployment/hosting tool than IDE

**Signal (#4, 17/20):**
- Clear communication metaphor
- Signal messaging app creates brand confusion
- Less Lighthouse synergy

**Compass (#5, 17/20):**
- Navigation is clear
- Common metaphor (less unique)
- "Compass" used in other dev tools
